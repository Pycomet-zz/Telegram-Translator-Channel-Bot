    Event fired when one or more messages are deleted.

    .. important::

        Telegram **does not** send information about *where* a message
        was deleted if it occurs in private conversations with other users
        or in small group chats, because message IDs are *unique* and you
        can identify the chat with the message ID alone if you saved it
        previously.

        Telethon **does not** save information of where messages occur,
        so it cannot know in which chat a message was deleted (this will
        only work in channels, where the channel ID *is* present).

        This means that the ``chats=`` parameter will not work reliably,
        unless you intend on working with channels and super-groups only.
